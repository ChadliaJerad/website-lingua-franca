The Lingua Franca extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides syntax-directed editing capability, compilation, and diagram synthesis for Lingua Franca programs.

## Installing the VS Code Extension

The Lingua Franca extension is available from the [VS Code
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lf-lang.vscode-lingua-franca)/[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/lf-lang/vscode-lingua-franca).

To install it, open the <kbd>Extensions</kdb> tab, search for "Lingua Franca" and click on the <kbd>Install</kbd> button. You can also open the command pallette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and enter `ext install lf-lang.vscode-lingua-franca`.

### Switching to Pre-Release

If you want to use the very latest, nightly-built version of the extension, you can install it by switching to the "pre-release" version. To do this, look up the extension by searching for "Lingua Franca" in the <kbd>Extensions</kbd> tab and click on the <kbd>Switch to Pre-Release Version</kbd> button. You can always switch back by clicking the <kbd>Switch to Release Version</kbd> button that will appear after enabling the "pre-release" version. (A reload may be required to complete switching between versions.)

## Using the Visual Studio Code Extension

### Creating a new file

To create a new LF file, go to <kbd>File > New File...</kbd> and select `New Lingua Franca File`. When saving the file, save it in a directory called `src` to make sure that generated code is placed conveniently in an adjacent `src-gen` directory. For instance, for a file called `Foo.lf`, the directory structure after building should look something like this:

```
bin/Foo
src/
â”” Foo.lf
src-gen/Foo
```

### Rendering diagrams

To show the diagram for the currently active Lingua Franca file, click on the diagrams icon at the upper right:

<img src="../../../../../img/vs_code/diagrams_icon.png" class="icon">

### Compilation

To compile the `.lf` source, open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and then enter `Lingua Franca: Build`.

### Running

You can also build and immediately afterwards run your code by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and then entering `Lingua Franca: Build and Run`.
Running the code can also be done from the VS Code terminal by executing the generated file in `./bin`.

## Notes

### For Python Users

Users who edit LF programs with a Python target will benefit the most from Python linting by installing Pylint 2.12.2 or later.

## Building from Source

To build the extension from source, clone our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lf-lang/vscode-lingua-franca) and run `npm install`.
