A subset of LF syntax is used to write _expressions_, which represent values in the target language. Expressions are used to initialize state variable and to give values to parameters. Arbitrary expressions in the target language can always be given within delimiters `{= ... =}`, but simple forms do not require the delimiters. These simple forms are documented here.

## Basic expressions

The most basic expression forms, which are supported by all target languages, are the following:

- Literals:
  - Numeric literals, e.g. `1`, `-120`, `1.5`, `3.14e10`. Note that the sign, if any, is part of the literal and must not be separated by whitespace.
  - String literals, e.g. `"abcd"`. String literals always use double-quotes, even in languages which support other forms (like Python).
  - Character literals. e.g. `'a'`. Single-quoted literals must be exactly one character long --even in Python.
  - Boolean literals: `true`, `false`, `True`, `False`. The latter two are there for Python.
- Parameter references, which are simple identifiers (e.g. `foo`). Any identifier in expression position must refer to a parameter of the enclosing reactor.
- Time values, e.g. `1 msec` or `10 seconds`. The syntax of time values is `integer time_unit`, where `time_unit` is one of the following:

  - **nsec** or **ns**: nanoseconds
  - **usec** or **us**: microseconds
  - **msec** or **ms**: milliseconds
  - **sec**, **second**, or **s**: seconds
  - **minute** or **min**: 60 seconds
  - **hour**: 60 minutes
  - **day**: 24 hours
  - **week**: 7 days

  Each of these units also support a plural version (e.g., `nsecs`, `minutes`, and `days`), which means the same thing.

  The time value `0` need not be given a unit, but for all other values, the unit is required.

  Time values are compatible with the `time` type.

- Escaped target-language expression, e.g. `{= foo() =}`. This syntax is used to write any expression which does not fall into one of the other forms described here. The contents are not parsed and are used verbatim in the generated file.

<div class="lf-c">

For instance, to have a 2-dimensional array as a parameter in C:

```
reactor Foo(param:{= int[][] =}({= { {1}, {2} } =})) {
    ...
}
```

Both `int[][]` and `{{1}, {2}}` are C fragments here, not LF.

</div>

<div class="lf-py">

For instance, to assign a 2-dimensional list as an initial value to a parameter
in the Python target:

```lf-py
reactor Foo(param({= ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) =})) {
    ...
}
```

</div>

## Collections

$page-showing-target$

To avoid the awkwardness of using the code delimiters `{= ... =}`, Lingua Franca supports initialization of simple arrays and similar structures. The interpretation is slightly different in each target language.

<div class="lf-c">

In C, a parameter or state may be given an array value as in the following example:

```lf
reactor Foo(param:double[](0.0, 1.0, 2.0)) {
    ...
}
```

This will become an array of length three. When instantiating this reactor, the default parameter value can be overridden using a similar syntax:

```lf
main reactor {
    f = new Foo(param = (3.3, 4.4, 5.5));
}
```

See the [C reactor documentation](/docs/handbook/c-reactors) for details and alternative syntaxes.

</div>

<div class="lf-cpp">

In C++, initial values for a parameter or state can be used to pass arguments to a constructor, as in the following example:

```lf-cpp
    state x: int[](1,2);
```

Here, the type `int[]` is translated by the code generator into `std::vector` and the `(1,2)` to constructor arguments, as in `new std::vector(1,2)`. See the [C++ reactor documentation](/docs/handbook/cpp-reactors#using-state-variables) for details and alternative syntaxes.

</div>

<div class="lf-py">

In Python, a parameter or state variable may be assigned an array expression as its initial value, as in the following example:

```lf-py
reactor Foo(param(1, 2, 3)) {
    state x(1, 2, 3)
    ...
}
```

The Python target interprets the `(1, 2, 3)` expression differently depending on
whether the assignee is a parameter or a state variable. For parameters, the
`(1, 2, 3)` expression will translate into an immutable Python tuple (i.e.,
`param = (1, 2, 3)`). For state variables, the `(1, 2, 3)` expression will
translate into a mutable Python list (i.e., `x = [1, 2, 3])`). The reason behind
this discrepancy is that parameters are assumed to be immutable after
instantiation (in fact, they are also read-only in reaction bodies), but state
variables usually need to be updated during execution.

<!-- In Python, `[1, 2, 3]` defines a list, which is mutable, whereas `(1, 2, 3)` defines a tuple, which is not mutable. To support this distinction, both syntaxes are available in Lingua Franca without code delimiters. For example, -->

Notice that even though the tuple assigned to the parameter is immutable (you
cannot assign new values to its elements), the parameter itself can be
overridden with _another_ immutable tuple when instantiating the reactor:

```lf-py
main reactor {
    f = new Foo(param = (3, 4, 5))
}
```

See the [Python reactor documentation](/docs/handbook/cpp-reactors#python-reactors) for details and alternative syntaxes.
