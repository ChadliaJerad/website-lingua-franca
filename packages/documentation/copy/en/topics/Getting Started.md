## Minimal Example

A minimal but complete Lingua Franca file with one reactor is this:

```lfc
target C;
main reactor {
    reaction(startup) {=
        printf("Hello World.\n");
    =}
}
```

```lfcpp
target Cpp;
main reactor {
    reaction(startup) {=
        cout << "Hello World.\n";
    =}
}
```

```lfpython
target Python;
main reactor {
    reaction(startup) {=
        print("Hello World.")
    =}
}
```

```lfts
target TypeScript;
main reactor {
    reaction(startup) {=
        console.log("Hello World.");
    =}
}
```

```lfrust
target Rust;
main reactor {
    reaction(startup) {=
        println!("Hello World.");
    =}
}
```

Every Lingua Franca program begins with a [target specification](target-specification) giving the language in which reactions are written. This is also the language of the program(s) generated by the Lingua Franca compiler.

Every LF program also has a `main` or `federated` reactor, which is the top level of a hierarchy of contained and interconnected reactors. The above simple example has no contained reactors. Its `main` reactor has a single reaction to the `startup` trigger, which causes the reaction to execute at the logical start time of the program. The body of the reaction, delimitted by `{= ... =}`, is ordinary code in the target language.

## Structure of an LF Project

The Lingua Franca tools assume that every such file is put somewhere within a directory called `src`. Create such a directory within your chosen **project root** directory. Put the above code in a file `src/Minimal.lf`. You can compile the code on the [command line]{FIXME} or within your [IDE]{FIXME}. On the command line this will look like this:

<pre class="lfc">
    > lfc src/Minimal.lf
</pre>

This will create more directories within the project root, typically `src-gen` and `bin`. The `src-gen` directory will have one or more generated files in the target language.

<p class="lfc lfcpp rust">
After compiling `Minimal.lf` with `lfc`, the `bin` directory will have an executable file called `Minimal`. Executing that file will result, not surprisingly, in printing "Hello World". If the target language is an interpreted language (like Python and TypeScript), then you run the program using the generated file in `src-gen`.

## Reactor Block

A **reactor** is a software component that reacts to input events, timer events, and internal events. It has private state variables that are not visible to any other reactor. Its reactions can consist of altering its own state, sending messages to other reactors, or affecting the environment through some kind of actuation or side effect.

The general structure of a reactor block is as follows:

> **reactor** _name_ (_[parameters](#parameter-declaration)_) {<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[state declarations](#state-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[method declarations](#method-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[input declarations](#input-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[output declarations](#output-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[timer declarations](#timer-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[action declarations](#action-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[reaction declarations](#reaction-declaration)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp;_[contained reactors](#contained-reactors)_<br/> > &nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br/>
> }

Parameter, inputs, outputs, timers, actions, and contained reactors all have names, and the names are required to be distinct from one another.

If the **reactor** keyword is preceded by **main**, then this reactor will be instantiated and run by the generated code. If an imported LF file contains a main reactor, that reactor is ignored. Only reactors that not designated `main` are imported. This makes it easy to create a library of reusable reactors that each come with a test case or demonstration in the form of a main reactor.
